            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE deÅ¿ign of this Book is twofold:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> To give many and clear DemonÅ¿trations, that King <hi>Charles</hi> the FirÅ¿t was no Å¿uch Saint or Martyr as he has been commonly reputed, nor yet a true ProteÅ¿tant; but on the contrary, a great favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of PapiÅ¿ts, and an oppreÅ¿Å¿ive Tyrant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To vindicate the juÅ¿t ReÅ¿iÅ¿tance the Parliament of 1640, and People, were conÅ¿train'd for their own Å¿afety to make.</p>
            <p>I foreÅ¿ee this TreatiÅ¿e will meet with two Objections, FirÅ¿t, That it contradicts the old Maxim, <hi>De mortuis nihil niÅ¿i bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> The Å¿econd, That it treats a crowned Head (nay, a pious Martyr's too) with little reÅ¿pect.</p>
            <p>To the firÅ¿t I anÅ¿wer, That <hi>bonum</hi> here muÅ¿t be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood <hi>quaÅ¿i verum,</hi> that is, do not wrong or belie the Dead, for they are not in being to juÅ¿tify their own Innocency: otherwiÅ¿e it will not only reflect on profane but Å¿acred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tory, nothing being more common in both, than to record the evil Actions even of Princes themÅ¿elves. I find this Maxim Å¿ometimes highly inÅ¿iÅ¿ted on by Å¿ome of our Clergy and Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eÅ¿pecially in favour of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. At other times theÅ¿e Å¿ort of men make not the leaÅ¿t Å¿cruple (for Å¿iniÅ¿ter ends) moÅ¿t unjuÅ¿tly to vilify, as the greateÅ¿t Villains imaginable, the Parliament of 1640, and thoÅ¿e worthy Patriots that join'd with it, to prevent the then many apparent inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Popery and Arbitrary Power, that King, his Queen, and evil CounÅ¿ellors were bringing on the three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>To the Å¿econd, of reÅ¿pecting this crowned Head, I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s I have not treated him as I would a King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">

               </gap>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100997:3"/>for the good of his People according to Law, but as a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> who cannot pretend to the leaÅ¿t Love or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from any of his Subjects; except thoÅ¿e PapiÅ¿ts and others that were his Favorites, and were embarked in the Å¿ame wicked DeÅ¿igns with him, eÅ¿teem it a great Sin to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize and deify the beÅ¿t MagiÅ¿trate on Earth, but a much greater, to adore a bloody and tyrannical OppreÅ¿Å¿or. And if the Å¿ame men will, through cuÅ¿tom, Å¿implicity, or want of information, no otherwiÅ¿e conÅ¿ider Kings than in the gaudy name of <hi>MajeÅ¿ty,</hi> and admire them and their doings, as if they breathed not the Å¿ame Breath with other mortal men, I thank God I have learnt better; and plainly Å¿ee with what a beÅ¿otted and degenerated baÅ¿eneÅ¿s of Å¿pirit, imbaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardized from the antient nobleneÅ¿s of their AnceÅ¿tors, they have not only in a religious, but a civil kind of Idolatry, idoliz'd this King, and ador'd the Image and Memory of him, who hath offered at more cunning fetches to undermine the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> and put Tyranny into an Art, than any <hi>BritiÅ¿h</hi> King before him.</p>
            <p>To make good my Charge againÅ¿t this Prince, I Å¿hall firÅ¿t prove, that the general courÅ¿e of his Actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with what a <hi>Saint</hi> doth, and ought to do: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. He was a proud <hi>Nimrod,</hi> a hardened <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> 2. A great <hi>Liar,</hi> (if he writ the Book call'd <hi>Eicon BaÅ¿ilike</hi>) for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t the many falÅ¿e AÅ¿Å¿ertions againÅ¿t, and AccuÅ¿ations of the Parliament, he begins with this notorious one, <hi>viz.</hi> That he call'd this laÅ¿t Parliament, not more by the advice of others, than his own choice and inclination; when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary was well known, both by the current of his own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by the Favorites about him. For further proof of this, let any unbiaÅ¿Å¿ed PerÅ¿on but read his PromiÅ¿es, Oaths, ProteÅ¿tations, and Å¿olemn Declarations to the Parliament, and conÅ¿ider how little of truth was in them, how the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in many of their Petitions charged him with the breach of them, and he will receive Å¿ufficient Å¿atisfaction. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Shall the JuÅ¿tice of God give place, and Å¿erve to glorify the Mercies of a Man? All other men that know what they ask, deÅ¿ire of God that their doings may tend to his Glory; But in this Prayer, God is required that his JuÅ¿tice would forbear to prevent, and as good as Å¿aid to intrench upon the Glory of a Man's Mercy. If God forbear his JuÅ¿tice, it muÅ¿t be, Å¿ure, to the magnifying his own Mercy; but here a mortal Man takes the boldneÅ¿s to ask that Glory out of his hand. He hated all thoÅ¿e that were eÅ¿teemed Religious, doubting that their Principles too much aÅ¿Å¿erted Liberty; this was plainly Å¿een by his vehement proÅ¿ecution of them.

            <p>TheÅ¿e deviliÅ¿h enÅ¿laving Doctrines, are moÅ¿t prejudicial and ungrateful to any people, that not only believe, but know, that they are Free-born Subjects: That all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was originally in the People, for they were before Kings: That all Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> came by their power, <hi>Ex Pacto aut Scelere,</hi> either by Compact, Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the People, or by UÅ¿urpation.

That if their AnceÅ¿tors were Å¿uch Fools, Knaves or Madmen to Å¿ell their Birthrights, as <hi>EÅ¿au</hi> did; the people of <hi>England</hi> know better things than to Å¿tand to that blind Bargain, it being againÅ¿t the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which teaches Self-preÅ¿ervation. Neither will the Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible part of Mankind any more believe, that any Kings have Å¿uch a Divine Right as will juÅ¿tifie their violating their Coronation Oaths, breaking through all the Laws of the Land, that are the Peoples chiefeÅ¿t Å¿ecurity: for they know and will preÅ¿erve the undoubted privileges of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born EngliÅ¿h Men.</p>

            <p>That it is unlawful to keep any Oaths, Vows and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to or for the King, that are againÅ¿t the good of the Kingdom; for the performing or keeping them would be an adding Å¿in unto Å¿in, wickedneÅ¿s unto wickedneÅ¿s, that is, to <hi>do Evil,</hi> as well as to promiÅ¿e the doing thereof.

            <p>That the Oath of Supremacy doth not allow him to be the Supreme LegiÅ¿lative Power of the Kingdom, and that he is in all CaÅ¿es the Å¿ole Judg, and over all perÅ¿ons an abÅ¿olute Lord, unto whoÅ¿e Will and PleaÅ¿ure the People are bound to be Å¿ubject Actively or PaÅ¿Å¿ively; for Å¿uch a Power becometh only thoÅ¿e that are perfect as God himÅ¿elf is perfect.</p>

            <p>That the King's voluntary and plenary breach of his Agreement with the People, doth <hi>ipÅ¿o facto</hi> diÅ¿charge the People from their Vows and Covenants, until Å¿uch time as the Agreement and Compact between the King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be again renewed, and united. The Nobility, Gentry and Clergy have in their noble aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance in the late Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution juÅ¿tified this PoÅ¿ition to the height, and alÅ¿o that Kings are accountable to their Subjects for their Male Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿tration.</p>
            <p>That the People of <hi>England</hi> cannot give the Parliament a power to enÅ¿lave themÅ¿elves, for thereby they would be Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betrayers, and in a degree Self murderers.

            <p>That what King <hi>James</hi> the FirÅ¿t told the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the Year 1609. is certainly true, viz. <hi>That he is no King but a Tyrant that governs not by Law.</hi>

            <p>That Kings and all MagiÅ¿trates ought to be NurÅ¿ing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not Bloody Tyrants to make their People miÅ¿erable, to reward Virtue, and not to encourage InjuÅ¿tice, OppreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion and Vice.

            <p>
               <hi>LaÅ¿tly,</hi> That if they will not govern thus according to Law and JuÅ¿tice, they muÅ¿t not think the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will be Å¿uch Fools as to Å¿tay for their accounting in the other World; for they do not love the <hi>WelÅ¿hmans</hi> reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which was <hi>to let her alone till the laÅ¿t Judgment, and then her would account fairly for all her Rogueries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I am very well Å¿atisfied (let the wretched Advocates for Tyranny and Arbitrary Power Å¿ay what they will to the contrary) That theÅ¿e Doctrines or Maxims cannot deÅ¿troy Government, becauÅ¿e they will not permit Governors to deÅ¿troy the People. Nay, they will eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h a JuÅ¿t Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by rooting out the UnjuÅ¿t. The Throne will be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed by RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, but ruined by WickedneÅ¿s. ThoÅ¿e Doctrines that rectifie Governors in the adminiÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Common Right and JuÅ¿tice, do faÅ¿ten the Crowns of Government upon their Heads; for by doing every man right, their Throne is Å¿et up in every man's Heart: and not only Å¿o, but the <hi>promiÅ¿ed PreÅ¿ence of an Infinite Power, will ever Å¿ecure and proÅ¿per Å¿uch AdminiÅ¿trations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e pious Doctrines do not implead Government, but the Evils thereof, and are all included in this, <hi>The Safety of the People is Å¿till the chiefeÅ¿t Lord, Rule, ReaÅ¿on and Law.</hi>

            <p>I could produce many more InÅ¿tances to inform the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded part of mankind, that this adored Prince was far from being a pious One; but for the preÅ¿ent Å¿hall give but one more clear DemonÅ¿tration, that is, His cauÅ¿ing a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be publiÅ¿hed and read in all Churches, that <hi>all Sports,</hi> &amp;c. whatÅ¿oever, were lawful on the <hi>Sabbath-day.</hi> How agreeable this moÅ¿t wicked Act can be to Religion I cannot conceive, and I am of opinion it will puzle all thoÅ¿e that in a blaÅ¿phemous Å¿train call him a Saint and Martyr to defend him from this horrid impiety.

            <p>I Å¿hall now proceed to Å¿hew that this King could not be a firm ProteÅ¿tant: His Letter to the Pope (printed at large in the Book called <hi>A Defence of the Parliament of</hi> 1640. <hi>and the People of</hi> England, <hi>againÅ¿t King</hi> Charles <hi>the FirÅ¿t and his Adherents</hi>) in anÅ¿wer to the Letter he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Pope, is enough to Å¿tartle any (but Å¿uch as <hi>Land</hi>'s) ProteÅ¿tants.

            <p>I Å¿hall now content my Å¿elf with enumerating a few more InÅ¿tances of his grievous oppreÅ¿Å¿ing the People of <hi>England</hi> as a Tyrant: <hi>viz.</hi> By his raiÅ¿ing, without Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 200000 <hi>l.</hi> on the poor Merchants for Ship-money, Coat and Conduct money. His great <hi>Minions</hi> and <hi>Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi> inventing new methods of Monopolies, without ever acquainting the Parliament, to enable him, in a full time of Peace, to live without a Parliament, as he did about 11 Years together; CompulÅ¿ive Knighthoods; the Å¿eizing, not of one <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, but of whole Inheritances, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of ForeÅ¿t, or Crown-lands; Corruption and Bribery compounded for, with Impunities granted for the future: Arbitrary and exceÅ¿Å¿ive Fines on thoÅ¿e People that Å¿tood in the gap againÅ¿t his <hi>Tyranny;</hi> beÅ¿ides the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous SlaÅ¿hings, Whippings, Pillorings, and horrible Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onments for many years. His intending to bow or break his People, to perÅ¿wade or force them to Å¿lavery, is Å¿o clear
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100997:9"/>by the whole courÅ¿e of his Reign, that 'tis amazing that men (even of the higheÅ¿t Å¿tamp of <hi>ToryiÅ¿m</hi>) Å¿hould have Front enough to deny it. He turn'd the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> out of his Secretary's place, becauÅ¿e he would not make the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary advances to <hi>Rome,</hi> but refuÅ¿ed to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Henry</hi> VII's Chappel, after PopiÅ¿h <hi>Laud</hi>'s way, which was not <hi>in Bread,</hi> but <hi>in Wafers.</hi> His undermining our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Government; his raiÅ¿ing an Army of <hi>EngliÅ¿h, Scots, Germans,</hi> and bloody <hi>IriÅ¿h</hi> PapiÅ¿ts, to Å¿ubject his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Fortunes to his Will and Power, and make good the Breaches upon the Liberties of <hi>England.</hi> That never was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Parliaments, nor to call them, but for a greedy hope of a whole National Bribe, his <hi>SubÅ¿idies;</hi> and never loved, never fulfil'd, never promoted the true End of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the RedreÅ¿s of Grievances, but Å¿till put them off and prolonged them, whether gratified or not gratified. That cauÅ¿ed Court Letters and Intimations to be Å¿ent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the People from their free electing the beÅ¿t affected to their Religion and Countries Liberties. That could not forbear declaring, that <hi>the execution of</hi> Strafford <hi>Å¿tung his ConÅ¿cience;</hi> and no marvel, when he was the chief Author of thoÅ¿e MiÅ¿deeds he Å¿uffered for. This <hi>Stafford</hi> was one of the boldeÅ¿t and moÅ¿t impetuous InÅ¿truments that the King had, to advance any violent or illegal DeÅ¿ign. He had ruled <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Å¿ome parts of <hi>England,</hi> in an arbitrary manner; he had endeavoured to Å¿ubvert the Fundamental Laws, to Å¿ubvert Parliaments, and incenÅ¿e the King againÅ¿t them. He had endeavoured to make HoÅ¿tility between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> he had counÅ¿el'd the King to call o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that <hi>IriÅ¿h</hi> Army of PapiÅ¿ts which he had cunningly raiÅ¿ed to reduce <hi>England,</hi> as appear'd by good teÅ¿timony then preÅ¿ent at the ConÅ¿ultation. For which and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Crimes proved againÅ¿t him in 28 <hi>Articles,</hi> he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of High-TreaÅ¿on by the Parliament. This pious Martyr could highly demonÅ¿trate his remorÅ¿e for the <hi>Blood of Strafford</hi> that all good Men acquitted him of, but not the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100997:9"/>
               <hi>leaÅ¿t Å¿orrow for Å¿etting up his Standard, and cauÅ¿ing a Sea of innocent Blood to be Å¿pilt by the Civil War, occaÅ¿ion'd by his Male AdminiÅ¿tration.</hi> That according to his own confeÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, violated the Privileges of the Commons, by going in an Arbitrary way into their HouÅ¿e. That as his Cabinet Letters declare, call'd them <hi>a mungrel Parliament, that vext his Queen with their baÅ¿e and mutinous Motions.</hi> A Å¿pecial Bargain of Å¿uch a <hi>Queen,</hi> at whoÅ¿e landing at <hi>Dover,</hi> the 25th of <hi>June</hi> (New-Å¿tile) 1625, the <hi>Sun</hi> withdrew its Beams, as being unwilling to Å¿hine upon a DeÅ¿cent Å¿o migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fatal to this Nation, and the Night hid the MiÅ¿eries which that Day were brought into this flouriÅ¿hing IÅ¿land upon her arrival.</p>
            <p>On the 26th the <hi>Queen</hi> with the <hi>King</hi> made their entry to <hi>London,</hi> having among others in her Train, <hi>A Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick BiÅ¿hop, on whom King</hi> Charles <hi>was obliged to Å¿ettle a PenÅ¿ion of</hi> 4000 <hi>l. a Year.

Two Clerks of the Chappel; two Grooms: Moreover,</hi> 12 <hi>PrieÅ¿ts of the Oratory, on whom</hi> 6000 <hi>l. were to be Å¿ettled for their Å¿ubÅ¿istence and maintenance.</hi> But beÅ¿ides all the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal PerÅ¿ons, the <hi>Queen,</hi> not to truÅ¿t to ProteÅ¿tants, brought over with her a Train of Roman Catholicks, whereof Å¿he form'd her HouÅ¿e, and, as it after prov'd, a Seminary in the Kingdom; four Ladies of Honour for her Bedchamber, Å¿ix Ladies of Honour with their Governante, and one under her, beÅ¿ides Servants; 18 Gentlemen, Å¿ix <hi>Valets de Chambre,</hi> a Chamberlain, a Secretary, five Chambermaids, SemÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es, LaundreÅ¿les, a PhyÅ¿ician, an Apothecary, Chirurgions, a Pantler, Cup-bearers, Cooks, Potagers, RoaÅ¿ters, Bakers, Stewards, Coachmen, and all the Officers of her Stables. At her coming up to <hi>London,</hi> almoÅ¿t all the People of that great City went before her (juÅ¿t as heretofore the Trojans did the HorÅ¿e that was the cauÅ¿e of their deÅ¿truction) in triumph into their City, with demonÅ¿trations of joy. But to their great Å¿orrow, theÅ¿e Halcion days laÅ¿ted but a Å¿hort
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100997:10"/>time, for they Å¿oon found the Queen's numerous Train of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticks cauÅ¿ed no Å¿mall clamours and murmuring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t the People all over the Kingdom; for theÅ¿e Vipers were in perpetual motion, and continually running from HouÅ¿e to HouÅ¿e under pretence of ConverÅ¿ion-work; openly boaÅ¿ting they had already converted many thouÅ¿ands in the little time they had been in <hi>England.</hi> Whereupon the King received divers Complaints, as well from ProteÅ¿tant BiÅ¿hops and MiniÅ¿ters, as from the MaÅ¿ters of Families, who accuÅ¿ed thoÅ¿e PrieÅ¿ts, not only of perverting their Servants, but their Children; and that by their wicked inÅ¿tigation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to their Parents, Å¿everal of them were gone away beyond Sea, to be put into Colleges and Convents, for their more commodious being bred up in the RomiÅ¿h Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: But upon all matters that happened as to that Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the Queen Å¿till Å¿tept into the Breach, to prevent by her Credit any MiÅ¿chiefs that Å¿hould have fallen on the PrieÅ¿ts. But the Complaints of the People againÅ¿t theÅ¿e Vermin the Queen brought with her were Å¿o great, that the King was neceÅ¿Å¿itated to Å¿end them back into <hi>France;</hi> which was done in <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> the Å¿ame Year he was crown'd. But at the Å¿ame time to prevent their complaining, the <hi>King</hi> heaped Favours, Benevolences and PreÅ¿ent upon all the Fry of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, to reward their labour of the Tares they had Å¿own and left behind them in <hi>England:</hi> However all this Liberality of the King was not Å¿ufficient to hinder their Complaints, nor their Sollicitations in the Court of <hi>France</hi> to return into <hi>England,</hi> to gather (as they Å¿aid) the Fruits of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The <hi>Queen</hi> on the other hand Å¿aw her Å¿elf foreÅ¿tall'd of her deÅ¿ire to propagate the Catholic Faith, eÅ¿pecially in her Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> and being puÅ¿h'd on by her ConfeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿or, and others of the Å¿ame brood, did not fail to write of this matter very Å¿martly to <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. her Brother, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the <hi>Queen Mother.</hi> And the King of <hi>France</hi> being puÅ¿hed on by the Queen Mother, took as a very great and Å¿enÅ¿ible Affront, the Å¿ending back of all the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:100997:10"/>that belonged to the Retinue, and were the DomeÅ¿tick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Queen his SiÅ¿ter. The Cardinal that was abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Governour of the King, was Å¿o angry to Å¿ee the <hi>French</hi> returned, (for that grievouÅ¿ly broke his MeaÅ¿ures in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) and prevailed Å¿o much on the King his MaÅ¿ter, that he got him to Å¿end over an EmbaÅ¿Å¿ador Extraordinary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with the Queen, and to make his complaints of it to the King. And that MiniÅ¿ter did his buÅ¿ineÅ¿s Å¿o effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that thoÅ¿e who had been diÅ¿miÅ¿Å¿ed, and obliged to leave the Kingdom, return'd to their former PoÅ¿t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Queen, their MiÅ¿treÅ¿s, and began their old trade of perverting people to the RomiÅ¿h Religion; which laÅ¿ted as long as the Queen continued in <hi>England.</hi> WhilÅ¿t the King was thus govern'd by his <hi>PapiÅ¿t Queen</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> how could <hi>poor England</hi> think of being happy, or free from <hi>Popery,</hi> and its natural ConÅ¿equence <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That inÅ¿tead of praying for his <hi>People,</hi> as a good King Å¿hould do, he pray'd to be delivered from them, as from wild BeaÅ¿ts, Inundations, and raging Seas, that had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born all Loyalty, (that is, would not let him be according to his Will, a great Tyrant) ModeÅ¿ty, Laws, JuÅ¿tice and Religion: God Å¿ave the People from Å¿uch InterceÅ¿Å¿ors.</p>
            <p>That the petitioning for removal of Evil CounÅ¿ellors, and redreÅ¿Å¿ing Grievances in Church and State, was to him an intolerable OppreÅ¿Å¿ion. His Å¿ending an Agent to <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> with Letters to that King, requiring Aid againÅ¿t the <hi>Parliament,</hi> beÅ¿ides the 8000 <hi>IriÅ¿h</hi> raiÅ¿ed by <hi>Strafford,</hi> which with a <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Army were to join the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> he then had. He encouraged the <hi>Scots</hi> by telling them, what Money and HorÅ¿e he was to have from <hi>Denmark;</hi> yielding to the hireling Army of <hi>Scotland,</hi> rather than to the reaÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable RequeÅ¿ts of his Parliament. His Å¿topping and way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying, both by Sea and Land, to his utmoÅ¿t power, thoÅ¿e ProviÅ¿ions and Supplies which the Parliament Å¿ent to relieve
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100997:11"/>the miÅ¿erable <hi>ProteÅ¿tants</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> clearly demonÅ¿trates he was deÅ¿irous of having them Å¿acrificed to his <hi>IriÅ¿h Friends,</hi> who were bloody Cut-throats. <hi>Ireland</hi> being as <hi>Ephraim,</hi> the <hi>Å¿trength of his Head; Scotland,</hi> as <hi>Judah,</hi> was his <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver;</hi> but over <hi>England,</hi> as over <hi>Edom,</hi> he meant to caÅ¿t his <hi>Shoe.</hi> His being Å¿o falÅ¿e in all his Treaties, as to follow his grand Maxim, <hi>viz.

            <p>That was Å¿o full of Revenge upon the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that he Å¿ent his <hi>violent Queen</hi> (who with the greateÅ¿t willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s went) to <hi>Holland,</hi> where <hi>Å¿he,</hi> by his order, <hi>pawn'd</hi> and Å¿et to Å¿ale the <hi>Crown Jewels,</hi> (a Crime heretofore counted treaÅ¿onable) for no other uÅ¿e, but to raiÅ¿e an Army of HorÅ¿e and Foot, with Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a very pious DeÅ¿ign to bring in a wicked parcel of Foreigners to cut his EngliÅ¿h Subjects Throats. This was a Martyr with a witneÅ¿s, by whom the Nation had been Å¿wallowed up with Blood and Ruin, had not his Strength fail'd him more than his Will. His admiring thoÅ¿e MiniÅ¿ters that Å¿trengthened his Hands, and hardened his Heart, and applauded him in his wilful ways againÅ¿t the Good of his People, to whom he was a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tantine.</hi> They were as dear and pleaÅ¿ing to him, as <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> the PrieÅ¿t of <hi>Bethel</hi> was to <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> for they had learnt not to propheÅ¿y againÅ¿t <hi>Bethel, for it is the King's Chappel, the King's Court:</hi> But his hating thoÅ¿e good and pious MiniÅ¿ters the <hi>Parliament</hi> Å¿ent him, proceeded from their telling him plain Truths, what was his Duty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t, and preaching up Repentance for what he had done. His moÅ¿t wrongfully pretending that he muÅ¿t kill or be killed, is Å¿o notoriouÅ¿ly falÅ¿e, that nothing can be clearer, it being very manifeÅ¿t that never was King leÅ¿s in danger of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100997:11"/>any violence from his Subjects, till he unÅ¿heath'd his Sword againÅ¿t them. Nay long after that time, when he had Å¿pilt the Blood of thouÅ¿ands, they had Å¿till his PerÅ¿on in a fooliÅ¿h veneration. His own Letters taken at the Battel of <hi>NaÅ¿eby</hi> were of great importance, to let the People Å¿ee what Faith there was in all his PromiÅ¿es and Å¿olemn Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tations: they diÅ¿covered his good Affection to PapiÅ¿ts and IriÅ¿h Rebels; the Å¿trict Intelligence he held; the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and diÅ¿honourable Peace he made with them; not Å¿ollicited, but rather Å¿olliciting, which by all Invocations that were holy he had in publick abjured. See the Articles of Peace abridged, in <hi>the Defence of the Parliament of</hi> 1640, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> TheÅ¿e Letters revealed his Endeavours to bring in Foreign Forces, <hi>IriÅ¿h, French, Dutch, Lorainers,</hi> and our old Invaders the <hi>Danes,</hi> upon <hi>England.</hi> TheÅ¿e were viÅ¿ible to all men under his own hand, and were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Parliament to be printed for publick Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100997:12"/>Was it not high time to Å¿tand up, when all that was dear to Free-born <hi>EngliÅ¿hmen</hi> was at Å¿take? Was not the King a great favourer of PapiÅ¿ts, and lover of Tyranny? Was he not ruled by his violent PopiÅ¿h Queen, a wicked, corrupt and Arbitrary Nobility, Gentry and Clergy, many of them of mean fortunes, that were unhappy for HimÅ¿elf, but more unhappy for his Kingdom? And were Å¿uch perÅ¿ons as theÅ¿e fit to be truÅ¿ted by the people?

               <p>For a concluÅ¿ion of this DiÅ¿courÅ¿e, I Å¿hall make a few Remarques, which I hope, if well obÅ¿erved, may be very uÅ¿eful not only to this preÅ¿ent age, but to poÅ¿terity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I Å¿hall give a Å¿hort AnÅ¿wer to this QueÅ¿tion, <hi>Why do the generality of the Clergy and Laity Å¿o much adore and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize all Monarchs</hi> (whether good or bad) <hi>above the People?</hi> The ReaÅ¿on is plain, The People have nothing material in a Monarchical Government to beÅ¿tow upon theÅ¿e <hi>Court Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raÅ¿ites,</hi> for the Kings have the diÅ¿poÅ¿al of the BiÅ¿hopricks, Deanaries, Prebendaries, Archdeaconries, and moÅ¿t other great Livings, and alÅ¿o moÅ¿t of the Temporal beneficial Places, as Chancellors, Judges and other great Offices; from Å¿uch a Å¿ort of men as theÅ¿e nothing but Court-Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines can be expected; for they are well aÅ¿Å¿ured, Å¿hould they preach or write for the Rights or Privileges of the People in Arbitrary Reigns, it would be the ready way to daÅ¿h all their hopes of preferment into pieces. And here I cannot but make a melancholy ObÅ¿ervation, as to the Clergy in general of the late Reigns, <hi>viz.</hi> That by all I could hear or read, they have been Å¿o far from being ChriÅ¿tian Advocates for the Rights and Privileges of milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of people, that they have in a moÅ¿t wicked manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted and preached up thoÅ¿e Doctrines that plainly tended to make them miÅ¿erable and laÅ¿ting Slaves. Indeed I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s Å¿ome few of them have Å¿ignalized themÅ¿elves for the good of the People, and againÅ¿t Popery. Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that incomparable Phoenix of our Age, Mr. <hi>SAM<g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>EL JOHNSON,</hi> a perÅ¿on that by his Å¿enÅ¿ible ConverÅ¿ation, and his golden Works, hath done more Å¿ervice, to reÅ¿cue <hi>England</hi> from Popery and Slavery, and Å¿ecure EngliÅ¿h mens Rights and Privileges, than moÅ¿t (if not all) the BiÅ¿hops and Clergy-men ever did Å¿ince the Reformation.

What occaÅ¿ions the Clergy's uÅ¿urping one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince more than belongs to them, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> when, God knows, they have work enough to preach the GoÅ¿pel as they ought to do, that their <hi>Flocks might be well fed with the Milk of God's Word?</hi> 1. Want of that true Piety that would keep them cloÅ¿er to their duties to God and men. 2. As I hinted before, they pick up Å¿craps of Law to make Princes great, that they may get promotion thereby, tho to the Å¿acrificing of their Country. <hi>LaÅ¿tly,</hi> The imprudent familiarity the Nobility and Gentry have with them, many of whom are poor, ignorant, impious and Å¿candalous fellows, that ariÅ¿e from being PariÅ¿h Boys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which makes them Å¿o proud as to Å¿trut and lord it over the People to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious degree. I would by no means be thought by this, to be an enemy to pious good Clergy-men, that as ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an MiniÅ¿ters diÅ¿charge their duties; for I Å¿olemnly profeÅ¿s I have the higheÅ¿t value and eÅ¿teem for all Å¿uch holy men.

And if any of them Å¿hall tranÅ¿greÅ¿s in this matter, they immediately forfeit their reputation and eÅ¿teem with the people. And if they Å¿hould in their Pulpits preÅ¿ume to meddle with State-affairs, and the MagiÅ¿trates hear of it, they Å¿end them a pair of Shoos, and order them to be gone.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I Å¿hall obÅ¿erve, That the keeping up the 30th of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> hath never, as I could learn, done the leaÅ¿t good, but much burt to theÅ¿e Kingdoms; for it hath given, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100997:15"/>Å¿till gives the Clergy (who rarely preach or write for the good of the Kingdom) an opportunity of poiÅ¿oning the People with lying Stories, and dangerous Notions, many of them crying up this King (to the great Å¿candal of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tianity) in a blaÅ¿phemous manner, venting Å¿uch horrid ExpreÅ¿Å¿ions as theÅ¿e in his behalf, <hi>viz.</hi> THAT HIS BLOOD CRIED LOWDER FOR VENGEANCE, THAN THE BLOOD OF JESUS (our dear Redeemer.)

               <p n="2">2. Contrary to all ChriÅ¿tianity, it effectually keeps up perpetual AnimoÅ¿ities, Wraths, Feuds, and DiviÅ¿ions, in theÅ¿e three Kingdoms.

For what good Man can hear (without a juÅ¿t reÅ¿entment) his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tors that ventured their <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>TreaÅ¿ure</hi> for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their Country, be moÅ¿t falÅ¿ly and wickedly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned as <hi>Rebels,</hi> by a parcel of Clergymen, generally Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for Tyranny, and many of them little Å¿neaking, ignorant, and Å¿candalous Fellows, who on this <hi>madding Day</hi> impudently vent their <hi>lying Harangues</hi> againÅ¿t them, who under God were the InÅ¿truments of much happineÅ¿s to <hi>England?</hi>

               <p n="4">4. This Å¿olemn obÅ¿ervation is pleaÅ¿ing or acceptable to none, but thoÅ¿e wicked Clergy-men or Laymen, that either had a hand in thoÅ¿e arbitrary doings of that King; or that would Å¿till maintain and juÅ¿tifie Å¿uch pernicious Doctrines and Actions. Neither is it to be wondred at, that Å¿ome of the Laymen are for keeping up this day; by reaÅ¿on thy now enjoy the EÅ¿tates of thoÅ¿e men that aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted in the redemption of their oppreÅ¿Å¿ed Country: for the old Saying is true, <hi>IntereÅ¿t may flatter, but it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lie.</hi>
